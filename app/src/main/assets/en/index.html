<h1>1. Topic analysis</h1>
<div>
    <h2>1.1. Problem definiton</h2>
    <p>Biomedical imaging is necessary element of medical care and is being improved in amazing pace
        thanks to deep learning. Semantic segmentation algorithms allow for image analysis and some
        level of automation in diffrent applications. However desiging such specialized solution is
        not a trival thing and is strictly dependent with dataset properties and hardware
        configuration. </p>
    <p>Semantic segmentation transforms raw biomedical images to significant, structured information
        and can have important role in scientific discoveries and in everyday medical
        diagnosis. </p>
    <h2>1.2. Analysis of available solutions</h2>
    <p>Every year there are more and more ready-t0-go solutions for Brain MRI image segmentation in
        order to detect brain tumor.
        Mainly thanks to yearly international competition BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation
        challenge).
        During this competition teams design and train their models and best teams are rewarded with
        prizes.
        Each year models submitted for BraTS are more precise than their predecessors and more
        accuracy means more medical doctors may be willing to try methods based on artificial
        intelligence.
    </p>
    <p> Most popular solutions: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>nnU-Net</li>
        <li>DeepMedic</li>
        <li>MedicalZoo</li>
        <li>SegAN</li>
        <li>Segtran</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most models are base on U-Net architecture, which is known for getting very good results in
        tasks with biomedical data. Results are often made public as tools prepared for training
        with your own data and with your own set of parameters(parameters are often optional).
    </p>
    <h2>1.3. Description of selected models</h2>
    <h3>nnU-Net</h3>
    <p>Method created with ability to handle variance of multiply datasets, which are common in this
        domain. This method automates some decisions about building segmentation pipeline for given
        dataset.
        nnU-Net can be used in 3 diffrent ways: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standardized benchmark - without any manual setting manipulation researchers can compare
            theirs algorithms with nnUNet o given dataset.
        </li>
        <li>Out-of-the-box segmentation method - inexperienced users can in easy way, without manual
            alterations use this tool for their own segmentation task.
        </li>
        <li>Framework - authors can create their own modifications and after that evaluate results
            of changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>yixinmpl-20</h3>
    <p>This solution is based on nnU-Net, but has few very interesting modification witch slightly
        enhances its performance. It is publish as docker image and should be used as out of the box
        segmentation method, where on input is given path if dataset and algorithm returns directory
        with output data. </p>
    <h3>DeepMedic</h3>
    <p>System that allows for training shared model with your own data, and test returned results.
        This system can by used without any modifications, however if there is need for changing
        part of its implementation there is an easy way to do it.</p>
