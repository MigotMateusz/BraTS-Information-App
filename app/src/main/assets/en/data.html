<h1>2. Data</h1>
<p>The data is provided each year by organizers of the BraTS competition. They are extensive,
    clinically obtained multiparameter MRI (mpMRI) scans of glioblastoma with pathologically
    confirmed diagnosis.
    Tumor sub-region data annotations are made and approved by neuroradiology experts
    for each patient in training, validation, and test data.
    Training data is shared along with annotations created by experts, while
    annotations for validation and test data remain confidential.</p>
<p>All mpMRI scans are saved as NIfTI files(.nii.gz). This type of data is special for neurological
    images. These images consist of 4 modalities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>T1(native)</li>
    <li>T1Gd(with contrast)</li>
    <li>T2(native)</li>
    <li>FLAIR(fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these modalities has been obtained by a different medical protocol and with
    various scanning devices. The segmentations were created by 1 up to 4
    evaluators.
    Annotations include classes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>GD-enhancing tumor</li>
    <li>Peritumoral edematous</li>
    <li>Necrotic tumor core</li>
</ul>
