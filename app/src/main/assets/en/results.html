        <h1>3. Results</h1>
        <p>As part of the engineering project, the nnUNet 2d model was trained on the training data of 1,251 patients.
            Trained models like nnUNet 3d full resolution and nnUNet 3d full resolution with data augmentation were also used.
            Fourth models in use is the yixnimpl-20 model</p>
        <p>All 4 models where used in creation of diffrent ensembles(soft voting, hard voting).</p>

            <h2>3.1. Classification committees</h2>
            <p>Classification committees are a very simple method of getting a better model through
                combining the forecasts computed by individual models and selecting the class that had
                the most votes. Often, such classifier achieves greater accuracy than the best
                classifier in the team.
                This method works best when the classifiers are as independent of each other as they can get. </p>
            <p>Voting classifiers can obtain the final result in 2 ways. By voting
                majority, where the number of votes is simply counted, or
                by soft voting, where the probabilities of belonging to the class are averaged and then
                class with the highest probability is selected.</p>
            <h2>3.2. Solution</h2>
            <p>Committees with majority voting and soft voting have been created in various
                configurations and an evaluation of these models was carried out for comparison and selection
                of the best model. The models will then be further analyzed and will remain
                conclusions drawn from the collected data</p>
